ABSTRACT:

The point of the task is to set up a twelve-hour Digital Clock that shows the time carefully, as against an easy clock, wherever the time is shown by the places of turning hands. With the help of counters and decoders, a complicated clock to point out time in hours, minutes and seconds are often built. computerized clock incorporates a counter that gets a clock signal from any supply and expands the quantity as per the clock signal. The principle clock signal having one Hertz repeat is allowed to the ten years counter which supplies double result to the decoder driver. This driver interprets the twofold contribution to decimal and sends it to the seven-fragment show. The counter triggers the counter about to it once it resets. The leftover counters work on these lines by obtaining a clock signal from the past counter and giving a clock sign to the subsequent counter when it resets. Seven-portion show is a particularly traditional and productive alternative for showing a decimal worth. The venture centers around building a complicated clock with basic doors, goes back and forth and counters with sequential principle instead of any programming based mostly part.

INTRODUCTION:

The point of the task is to set up a twelve-hour Digital Clock that shows the time carefully, as critical a straightforward clock, wherever the time is shown by the places of turning hands. With the help of counters and decoders, an advanced clock to point out time in hours, minutes and seconds may be built. processed clock includes a counter that gets a clock signal from any supply and expands the quantity as per the clock signal. The principle clock signal having one Hertz repeat is allowed to the ten years counter which supplies double result to the decoder driver. This driver interprets the twofold contribution to decimal and sends it to the seven-fragment show. The counter triggers the counter getting ready to it once it resets. The leftover counters work on these lines by obtaining a clock signal from the past counter and giving a clock sign to the subsequent counter when it resets. Seven-portion show is an especially normal and productive alternative for showing a decimal worth. The venture centers around building an advanced clock with basic doors, goes back and forth and counters with consecutive explanation instead of any programming based mostly element.

Conclusion:

•	Hence, this is the manner by which our primary framework has been constructed up.
•	More and more information including the entire framework has been acquired with time and through more research.
•	We have finished this project effectively and have effectively made a 12 hour computerized clock with an alert and an A.M./P.M. show
